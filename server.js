Thank you for making a powerful pledge to say NO to drugs and stand up for a safer, healthier community.

Together, we are sending a clear message: Our community chooses health, safety, and a brighter future.

Stay strong, stay committed â€” and know that you are not alone in this mission.

With gratitude,
